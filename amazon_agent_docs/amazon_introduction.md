## Introduction

The `amazon-agent` is a specialized AI assistant engineered to automate a variety of e-commerce tasks, with a primary focus on interacting with platforms like Amazon. Its core purpose is to understand user requests related to online shopping and translate them into actions within a web browser, effectively acting as an automated shopping assistant.

To achieve its goals, the `amazon-agent` leverages browser automation. This means it programmatically controls a web browser to perform tasks such as:

*   Searching for products based on user queries (e.g., "find me a coffee maker under $50").
*   Navigating to product detail pages.
*   Adding products to the shopping cart.
*   Initiating the checkout process.
*   Managing orders (e.g., viewing history, canceling orders, or requesting refunds).

By combining natural language understanding (via an LLM) with browser automation capabilities, the `amazon-agent` aims to streamline and simplify online shopping workflows, particularly for repetitive or multi-step e-commerce operations. Its design, as indicated by its tools and operational flow, centers around interpreting user intent and executing corresponding actions directly on an e-commerce website.
