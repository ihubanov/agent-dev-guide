# Detailed Explanation of the Personal Agent

## Introduction

The personal-agent is a customizable AI agent designed to assist with a variety of tasks, including automation and productivity. As a part of the broader Agent Starter Kit, it provides a foundation for users to build and tailor an intelligent agent to their specific needs. Whether it's managing daily workflows, automating repetitive processes, or simply boosting overall productivity, the personal-agent offers a flexible framework that can be extended and adapted. Users can modify the agent's behavior through a system prompt, allowing for a high degree of personalization in how the agent responds and assists.

## Technology Stack

The personal-agent is built using a modern, robust technology stack, ensuring efficient development and reliable performance. The core components include:

*   **Node.js:** Serving as the runtime environment, Node.js allows the agent to execute JavaScript (and TypeScript) code server-side. Its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model is well-suited for building responsive and scalable applications. The use of Node.js is evident from the `Dockerfile` (e.g., `FROM node:22-alpine`) and scripts within the `package.json` file that utilize Node.js for execution.

*   **Express.js:** This minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework is used to build the agent's API. Express.js provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features. Its presence is confirmed by its inclusion in the `package.json` dependencies and its usage in `src/index.ts` for request handling and routing (e.g., `import express from "express"; const app = express();`).

*   **TypeScript:** As the primary programming language, TypeScript brings static typing to JavaScript, enhancing code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity. The project's use of `.ts` files (e.g., `src/index.ts`, `src/prompt/index.ts`), the `tsconfig.json` configuration file, and TypeScript-related packages listed in `package.json` (like `typescript` and various `@types/*` dependencies) clearly indicate its adoption.

## Directory Structure

The `examples/personal-agent/` directory is organized to provide a clear and maintainable structure for the agent's codebase. Key files and directories include:

*   **`src/`**: This is the main directory containing all the TypeScript source code for the agent.
    *   **`index.ts`**: The primary entry point of the application. It initializes and configures the Express.js server, sets up middleware, and defines API endpoints like `/health` and `/prompt`.
    *   **`constants.ts`**: Defines application-wide constants, such as environment variables for port numbers, API base URLs (e.g., `LLM_BASE_URL`), model names, and the system prompt if provided via environment variables.
    *   **`prompt/`**: This sub-directory encapsulates the logic related to interacting with the Large Language Model (LLM).
        *   **`index.ts`**: Contains the core functionality for LLM communication. This includes initializing the OpenAI API client, loading the system prompt (either from `system-prompt.txt` or an environment variable), constructing the messages payload, and handling the streaming of responses from the LLM.
        *   **`types.ts`**: Provides TypeScript type definitions for structures used in LLM interactions, such as `PromptPayload`, `Message`, `MessageRole`, and `ContentPart`, ensuring type safety and clarity in the codebase.
    *   **`__tests__/`**: This directory houses the test files for the agent.
        *   **`index.test.ts`**: An example test file (likely using a framework like Jest, as suggested by `jest.config.js`) for testing the agent's API endpoints or core functionalities.

*   **`system-prompt.txt`**: A plain text file containing the default system prompt that guides the AI's behavior, personality, and response style. This prompt is loaded by the `prompt/index.ts` logic if not overridden by an environment variable.

*   **`Dockerfile`**: Contains the instructions to build a Docker image for the personal-agent, specifying the base Node.js image, working directory, dependency installation, and the command to run the agent.

*   **`package.json`**: The standard Node.js project manifest file. It lists project metadata, dependencies (like `express`, `openai`, `typescript`), and devDependencies. It also defines useful scripts for running, developing, and testing the agent (e.g., `start`, `dev`, `test`).

*   **`.env.example`**: An example file demonstrating the required environment variables for the agent, such as `PORT`, `LLM_BASE_URL`, `LLM_API_KEY`, and `MODEL`. Users should copy this to a `.env` file and populate it with their specific configurations.

*   **`README.md`**: Provides documentation specific to the `personal-agent` example, including setup instructions, usage guidelines, and customization tips.

## Core Functionality - Request Handling

The personal-agent's ability to receive and process user requests is managed by an Express.js server defined in `src/index.ts`. This file orchestrates how incoming HTTP requests are handled, routed, and responded to.

### Express Server Setup

The foundation of the request handling mechanism is the Express server instance:

```typescript
import express from "express";
const app = express();
```

This `app` object is then configured with middleware and route handlers to manage different aspects of incoming requests.

### Middleware

Before requests reach specific route handlers, they pass through several middleware functions that enhance security, enable cross-origin requests, and parse request bodies:

*   **`helmet()`**: This middleware helps secure the application by setting various HTTP headers. For instance, it can help protect against common web vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) and clickjacking.
    ```typescript
    import helmet from "helmet";
    app.use(helmet());
    ```

*   **`cors()`**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) middleware allows the agent's API to be called from web applications running on different domains. This is essential for many modern web architectures.
    ```typescript
    import cors from "cors";
    app.use(cors());
    ```

*   **`express.json()`**: This built-in Express middleware parses incoming requests with JSON payloads (i.e., with a `Content-Type` of `application/json`). It makes the parsed JSON data available in `req.body`. A limit for the payload size is also configured.
    ```typescript
    app.use(express.json({ limit: "50mb" }));
    ```

### API Endpoints

The agent exposes specific endpoints to interact with it:

#### `/prompt` Endpoint

This is the primary endpoint for interacting with the LLM.

*   **Method and Path**: It handles `POST` requests to the `/prompt` path.
    ```typescript
    app.post("/prompt", handlePrompt);
    ```
*   **Request Payload**: The endpoint expects a JSON payload in the request body. A crucial part of this payload is a `messages` array, which typically contains the conversation history or the user's current query. This structure is defined in `src/prompt/types.ts`.
*   **Functionality**: When a request hits `/prompt`, the `handlePrompt` asynchronous function is invoked. This function takes the request and response objects, extracts the payload (especially the `messages`), and then calls the `prompt` function (imported from `src/prompt/index.ts`). The `prompt` function is responsible for the actual communication with the LLM, including sending the system prompt and user messages, and then streaming the LLM's response back to the client. The endpoint is designed to handle Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming.

#### `/health` Endpoint

This endpoint provides a basic health check for the server.

*   **Method and Path**: It handles `GET` requests to the `/health` path.
    ```typescript
    app.get("/health", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
      res.json({ status: "ok", timestamp: new Date().toISOString() });
    });
    ```
*   **Functionality**: When accessed, it returns a simple JSON response indicating that the server is running (`"status": "ok"`) along with the current server timestamp. This is useful for monitoring and uptime checks.

An unhandled error catching middleware is also present to provide a standardized error response.
```typescript
app.use((err: Error, req: Request, res: Response) => {
  console.error("Unhandled error:", err);
  res.status(500).json({
    error: err.message,
    stack: NODE_ENV === "production" ? undefined : err.stack,
  });
});
```

## Core Functionality - LLM Interaction

The heart of the personal-agent lies in its ability to communicate effectively with a Large Language Model (LLM). This interaction is primarily managed within the `src/prompt/index.ts` file, which handles everything from client initialization to processing the LLM's responses.

### OpenAI Client Initialization

To communicate with the LLM, an OpenAI client is initialized. This client is configured with credentials and connection parameters sourced from constants, which are typically set via environment variables:

```typescript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { MODEL, LLM_API_KEY, LLM_BASE_URL, SYSTEM_PROMPT } from "../constants";

const openAI = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: LLM_API_KEY,
  baseURL: LLM_BASE_URL,
  maxRetries: 3,
});
```

*   `LLM_API_KEY`: The API key for authenticating with the LLM provider.
*   `LLM_BASE_URL`: The base URL of the LLM service. This allows flexibility in using different OpenAI-compatible API providers or self-hosted models.
*   `maxRetries`: Configures the client to automatically retry requests up to 3 times in case of transient network issues.

### System Prompt Loading and Role

The system prompt plays a crucial role in guiding the LLM's behavior, defining its personality, task focus, and the desired style of its responses. The agent loads the system prompt using the following logic:

```typescript
const systemPrompt =
  SYSTEM_PROMPT || // Prioritizes environment variable
  fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, "../system-prompt.txt"), "utf8"); // Fallback to file
```

1.  It first checks if a `SYSTEM_PROMPT` environment variable is set. If so, its value is used.
2.  If the environment variable is not found, it falls back to reading the content of the `src/system-prompt.txt` file.

This dual approach allows for easy customization of the agent's core instructions without modifying the code, simply by changing an environment variable or the text file.

### The `prompt` Function

The main logic for LLM communication resides in the asynchronous `prompt` function:

```typescript
export const prompt = async (
  payload: PromptPayload
): Promise<string | ReadableStream<Uint8Array>> => {
  // ...
};
```

1.  **Message Construction**: The function receives a `payload` containing the user's messages (and potentially other parameters). It then constructs a `messages` array to be sent to the LLM. This array always begins with the loaded `systemPrompt` (assigned the "system" role), followed by the messages from the `payload` (which could be from the user or previous assistant responses).

    ```typescript
    const messages: Array<OpenAI.ChatCompletionMessageParam> = [
      {
        role: "system",
        content: systemPrompt,
      },
      ...(payload.messages as Array<OpenAI.ChatCompletionMessageParam>),
    ];
    ```

2.  **Sending the Request to LLM**: The constructed message list is then sent to the LLM using the `openAI.chat.completions.create` method.

    ```typescript
    const completion = await openAI.chat.completions.create({
      model: MODEL || "unknown", // Model name from constants
      messages,
      temperature: 0,
      stream: true,
      seed: 42,
    });
    ```

    Key parameters used here include:
    *   `model`: Specifies which LLM model to use (e.g., "gpt-3.5-turbo", "gpt-4", or a custom model name defined in constants).
    *   `messages`: The array of system and user/assistant messages.
    *   `stream: true`: This is a crucial parameter that requests the LLM to send its response as a stream of events (Server-Sent Events). This allows the agent to process and forward parts of the response as they become available, rather than waiting for the entire response to complete. This is essential for providing a responsive, real-time experience to the user.
    *   `temperature: 0`: Setting the temperature to 0 aims for more deterministic and less random responses. The LLM will be more likely to choose the highest probability words.
    *   `seed: 42`: When used in conjunction with a low temperature, providing a seed value can help in obtaining reproducible outputs from the LLM, which is beneficial for testing and scenarios requiring consistent responses. (Note: Reproducibility with LLMs can still be challenging and might depend on the specific model and provider.)

3.  **Streaming Response**: The function is designed to return a `ReadableStream<Uint8Array>`. It processes the incoming stream from the `completion` object, encodes each chunk, and forwards it through the controller of the `ReadableStream`. This enables the `/prompt` endpoint in `src/index.ts` to pipe the LLM's response directly to the client in real-time.

This careful orchestration of client setup, prompt management, and request parameters allows the personal-agent to effectively leverage the power of LLMs for various tasks.

## Core Functionality - Streaming Responses

A key feature of the personal-agent is its ability to stream responses from the Large Language Model (LLM) back to the client. This provides a much more responsive and real-time user experience, as users don't have to wait for the entire LLM response to be generated before seeing output. This mechanism is orchestrated between `src/prompt/index.ts` (the stream producer) and `src/index.ts` (the stream consumer and forwarder).

### Producing the Stream (`src/prompt/index.ts`)

The `prompt` function in `src/prompt/index.ts` is responsible for initiating the LLM interaction and producing a stream of data.

1.  **Returning a `ReadableStream`**: The function is declared to return `Promise<string | ReadableStream<Uint8Array>>`. For streaming requests, it specifically returns a `ReadableStream`.

    ```typescript
    export const prompt = async (
      payload: PromptPayload
    ): Promise<string | ReadableStream<Uint8Array>> => {
      // ...
      return new ReadableStream({
        async start(controller) {
          // ... stream logic ...
        },
      });
    };
    ```

2.  **Initiating LLM Stream**: Inside the `ReadableStream`'s `start` method, the call to the OpenAI API is made with the `stream: true` parameter:

    ```typescript
    const completion = await openAI.chat.completions.create({
      // ... other parameters ...
      stream: true,
    });
    ```

3.  **Enqueuing LLM Chunks as SSE**: As the LLM generates a response, it sends back chunks of data. The code iterates through these chunks. Each `chunk` received from the `completion` stream (which is an `OpenAI.ChatCompletionChunk`) is then formatted as a Server-Sent Event (SSE) string and enqueued into the `ReadableStream` controller. The SSE format `data: {JSON_chunk}\n\n` is used, ensuring the client can easily parse these events.

    ```typescript
    // Initial empty message to start the stream
    controller.enqueue(
      new TextEncoder().encode(
        `data: ${JSON.stringify(enqueueMessage(false, ""))}\n\n`
      )
    );

    for await (const chunk of completion) {
      if (chunk) {
        // Forward the raw chunk, already formatted as SSE by OpenAI library (or similar structure)
        // The chunk itself is a ChatCompletionChunk, which needs to be stringified for the data field of SSE
        controller.enqueue(
          new TextEncoder().encode(`data: ${JSON.stringify(chunk)}\n\n`)
        );
      }
    }
    controller.close(); // Close the stream when LLM is done
    ```
    *(Self-correction: The `enqueueMessage` utility is used for an initial message, the actual chunks from OpenAI are directly stringified and sent)*. The critical part is that each piece of data is prefixed with `data: ` and suffixed with `\n\n`.

### Consuming and Forwarding the Stream (`src/index.ts`)

The `handlePrompt` function in `src/index.ts` consumes the `ReadableStream` provided by the `prompt` function and forwards the data to the client over HTTP.

1.  **Setting SSE Headers**: Before sending any data, the server sets appropriate HTTP headers to inform the client that it should expect a stream of events:

    ```typescript
    res.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/event-stream");
    res.setHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache"); // Prevents caching of the stream
    res.setHeader("Connection", "keep-alive"); // Keeps the connection open for the duration of the stream
    ```

2.  **Reading from the Stream**: The `handlePrompt` function calls `await prompt(payload)` to get the stream. It then obtains a reader from the stream:

    ```typescript
    const result = await prompt(payload); // result is the ReadableStream
    if (result && typeof result === "object" && "getReader" in result) {
      const reader = (result as ReadableStream).getReader();
      // ... read loop ...
    }
    ```

3.  **Writing SSE Chunks to HTTP Response**: The code enters a loop, reading chunks from the stream using `await reader.read()`. Each `value` (which is a `Uint8Array` already formatted as an SSE event by the producer) is written directly to the HTTP response:

    ```typescript
    while (true) {
      const { done, value } = await reader.read();
      if (done) {
        // Stream is complete
        res.write("data: [DONE]\n\n"); // Signal end of stream to client
        break;
      }
      res.write(value); // Write the SSE formatted chunk
      // Flush the response to ensure immediate delivery
      if (typeof res.flush === "function") {
        res.flush();
      }
    }
    ```

4.  **Flushing**: After writing each chunk, `res.flush()` is called if available. This attempts to send any buffered data immediately to the client, which is crucial for the real-time effect of streaming.

5.  **Signaling Stream End**: Once the `reader.read()` returns `{ done: true }`, it signifies that the LLM has finished generating its response and the stream from `src/prompt/index.ts` is closed. The `handlePrompt` function then writes a final SSE event, `data: [DONE]\n\n`, to explicitly inform the client that the stream has concluded. The HTTP connection is then ended.

This two-part mechanism—producing SSE-formatted chunks in `src/prompt/index.ts` and consuming/forwarding them in `src/index.ts`—enables the personal-agent to deliver information from the LLM progressively.

## Configuration

The personal-agent is configured primarily through environment variables, allowing for flexibility in different deployment environments (development, production) and easy customization of key parameters without modifying the source code.

### Environment Variables and `.env`

The agent utilizes the `dotenv` package to manage environment variables. This is evident from the import statement at the very beginning of the main application file:

```typescript
// src/index.ts
import "dotenv/config";
```

This line ensures that when the application starts, `dotenv` will look for a file named `.env` in the root directory of the agent (alongside `package.json`). If this file exists, `dotenv` loads any variables defined within it into `process.env`, making them accessible throughout the application.

### `.env.example` File

To guide users on the required and optional environment variables, the project includes an `.env.example` file. This file serves as a template, listing the variables that the application recognizes. Users are expected to:

1.  Copy `examples/personal-agent/.env.example` to a new file named `examples/personal-agent/.env`.
2.  Edit the `.env` file to provide their specific values (e.g., API keys, port numbers).

The `.env` file itself should typically not be committed to version control, especially if it contains sensitive information like API keys.

### Key Configuration Variables

The following environment variables are defined and used in `src/constants.ts`, playing crucial roles in the agent's operation:

*   **`PORT`**:
    *   **Role**: Specifies the network port on which the agent's Express server will listen for incoming HTTP requests.
    *   **Default**: `80` (as seen in `src/constants.ts`, though the `dev` script in `package.json` often sets it to `4000` for development).

*   **`NODE_ENV`**:
    *   **Role**: Defines the Node.js environment mode. Common values are `development` or `production`. This can be used by the application to enable or disable certain features, like detailed error stacks in development.
    *   **Default**: `development`.

*   **`LLM_API_KEY`**:
    *   **Role**: Your API key for the Large Language Model provider (e.g., OpenAI). This is essential for authenticating requests to the LLM.
    *   **Default**: `sk-proj-unknown` (a placeholder). **Users must replace this with a valid API key.**

*   **`LLM_BASE_URL`**:
    *   **Role**: The base URL for the LLM API. This allows using OpenAI or compatible third-party/self-hosted LLM providers.
    *   **Default**: `http://localhost:65534` (often a port used by local LLM servers like LM Studio or Ollama).

*   **`MODEL`**:
    *   **Role**: Specifies the identifier of the LLM model to be used for chat completions (e.g., `gpt-4`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`, or a custom model name).
    *   **Default**: `model-name` (a placeholder). **Users should set this to their desired model.**

*   **`SYSTEM_PROMPT`**:
    *   **Role**: Allows overriding the default system prompt (read from `src/system-prompt.txt`) directly via an environment variable. This provides a quick way to change the agent's core instructions without editing files.
    *   **Default**: `""` (empty string), which means the agent will fall back to using `src/system-prompt.txt` by default.

By modifying these variables in their `.env` file, users can tailor the agent's behavior, connectivity, and deployment settings to their specific requirements.

## Packaging and Deployment (`Dockerfile`)

The `personal-agent` is designed to be easily packaged and deployed as a containerized application using Docker. The instructions for building the Docker image are defined in the `examples/personal-agent/Dockerfile`. This file allows for a consistent environment and simplifies the deployment process across different systems.

Let's break down the key instructions in the `Dockerfile`:

1.  **Base Image**:
    ```dockerfile
    FROM node:22-alpine
    ```
    This line specifies the base image for the Docker container. `node:22-alpine` is chosen because it's a lightweight, Alpine Linux-based image that includes Node.js version 22. Alpine images are significantly smaller than default Debian-based images, leading to faster build times and smaller container sizes, which is beneficial for deployment.

2.  **Working Directory**:
    ```dockerfile
    WORKDIR /app
    ```
    This sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`. All subsequent commands (`COPY`, `RUN`, `CMD`) will be executed relative to this path.

3.  **Copying Project Files**:
    ```dockerfile
    COPY ./package.json /app/package.json
    COPY ./ /app/
    ```
    These lines copy the project files into the container's `/app` directory.
    *   `COPY ./package.json /app/package.json`: Typically, `package.json` (and sometimes `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json`) is copied first. This is a Docker build optimization technique. If `package.json` hasn't changed between builds, Docker can use the cached layer from the previous build for dependency installation, speeding up the build process if only source code has changed.
    *   `COPY ./ /app/`: This command copies all other files from the current directory (where the `Dockerfile` is located, i.e., `examples/personal-agent/`) into the `/app` directory in the container. This includes the `src/` directory, `tsconfig.json`, and other necessary files. A `.dockerignore` file is usually present to exclude unnecessary files (like `node_modules/` from the host, `.git/`, etc.) from being copied.

4.  **Dependency Installation**:
    ```dockerfile
    RUN yarn
    ```
    This command executes `yarn` (which implies `yarn install`) inside the container. Yarn reads the `package.json` file (already copied) and installs all the project dependencies listed there.

5.  **Setting Environment Variable**:
    ```dockerfile
    ENV NODE_ENV="production"
    ```
    This sets the `NODE_ENV` environment variable within the container to `production`. This is a common practice for Node.js applications, as many libraries and frameworks (including Express) have optimizations that are enabled when `NODE_ENV` is set to `production` (e.g., caching, reduced logging).

6.  **Command to Run the Application**:
    ```dockerfile
    CMD ["yarn", "start"]
    ```
    The `CMD` instruction specifies the default command to run when a container is started from this image. In this case, it executes `yarn start`. This refers to the `start` script defined in the `package.json` file, which is typically `NODE_ENV=production tsx ./src/index.ts` or similar, responsible for launching the Node.js application.

### Purpose

By defining these steps in a `Dockerfile`, the personal-agent can be built into a portable container image. This image encapsulates the application, its dependencies, and its runtime environment. Once built, this image can be run consistently on any system that has Docker installed, whether it's a developer's local machine, a testing server, or a production cloud environment. This greatly simplifies deployment and reduces issues related to environment inconsistencies. The `pack.sh` script in the directory likely uses this Dockerfile to build and package the agent.

## Customization

The personal-agent is designed to be adaptable, allowing users to tailor its behavior and configuration to their specific needs and preferences. Customizations range from altering the agent's core personality and instructions to changing the underlying Large Language Model (LLM) and its parameters.

### 1. Modifying Agent Behavior (System Prompt)

The primary method for customizing how the agent responds and behaves is by modifying its system prompt. The system prompt provides the LLM with context and high-level instructions, guiding its personality, tone, and the focus of its replies. There are two ways to change the system prompt:

*   **Editing `src/system-prompt.txt`**:
    *   Users can directly edit the content of the `examples/personal-agent/src/system-prompt.txt` file. This file contains the default instructions for the agent. Any changes saved here will be loaded by the agent upon startup, unless overridden by the environment variable.
    *   The `README.md` for the personal-agent highlights this as a way to customize the agent, providing examples of how to craft these instructions.

*   **Setting the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` Environment Variable**:
    *   As defined in `src/constants.ts` and used in `src/prompt/index.ts`, the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` environment variable takes precedence over the `system-prompt.txt` file.
    *   If this environment variable is set, its value will be used as the system prompt, ignoring the content of the text file. This method is useful for making quick changes without altering project files, or for deploying the agent with different personalities in various environments.

### 2. LLM and Connection Parameters

Users can also customize which LLM is used and how the agent interacts with it:

*   **Changing the LLM Model (`MODEL`)**:
    *   The `MODEL` environment variable (defined in `src/constants.ts`) allows users to specify which LLM model the agent should use (e.g., `gpt-4`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`, or a custom model identifier). This is passed to the LLM API when creating chat completions.

*   **Using a Different LLM Provider/Instance**:
    *   The `LLM_BASE_URL` and `LLM_API_KEY` environment variables enable users to connect to different LLM providers or self-hosted instances. `LLM_BASE_URL` specifies the API endpoint, and `LLM_API_KEY` provides the necessary authentication.

*   **Adjusting LLM Parameters (Advanced)**:
    *   In `src/prompt/index.ts`, parameters like `temperature` and `seed` are passed to the LLM:
        ```typescript
        const completion = await openAI.chat.completions.create({
          // ...
          temperature: 0,
          stream: true,
          seed: 42,
        });
        ```
    *   Currently, `temperature` is hardcoded to `0` and `seed` to `42` to promote deterministic and consistent responses.
    *   Advanced users could modify these values directly in the code if more response variability (`temperature` > 0) or different consistent response sets (different `seed` values) are desired. However, exposing these via environment variables would be a further enhancement for easier configuration if needed.

### 3. Other Configurations

As detailed in the "Configuration" section, other environment variables like `PORT` and `NODE_ENV` can also be adjusted to suit different deployment or development setups.

By leveraging these customization options, users can significantly alter the personal-agent's functionality, making it a versatile tool for a wide range of AI-assisted tasks.

## How it Works - Summary Flow

The personal-agent processes user requests and interacts with the Large Language Model (LLM) in a straightforward, streaming-first manner. Here's a step-by-step summary of the request lifecycle:

1.  **User Request**: A client application sends an HTTP `POST` request to the `/prompt` endpoint of the personal-agent. The request body contains a JSON payload, which must include a `messages` array representing the conversation history or the user's current query.

2.  **Server Receives Request (`src/index.ts`)**: The Express.js server, defined in `src/index.ts`, receives this incoming request. The routing mechanism directs it to the `handlePrompt` asynchronous function.

3.  **Initiate LLM Interaction (`handlePrompt` calls `prompt`)**: The `handlePrompt` function extracts the `messages` (and any other relevant data) from the request payload. It then calls the `prompt` function, which is imported from `src/prompt/index.ts`, passing the payload to it.

4.  **Processing Inside `prompt` Function (`src/prompt/index.ts`)**:
    *   **System Prompt Retrieval**: The `prompt` function first determines the system prompt to be used. It prioritizes the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` environment variable. If this variable is not set or is empty, it falls back to reading the content of the `src/system-prompt.txt` file.
    *   **Message Assembly**: The retrieved system prompt (as a "system" role message) is then prepended to the array of user/assistant messages received in the payload. This combined list forms the complete conversational context provided to the LLM.
    *   **Nature of Interaction (Direct API Call)**: It's important to note that the interaction with the LLM is a direct API call to an OpenAI-compatible service. The "chain" of interaction is simply the ordered list of messages (system prompt + conversation history) sent to the LLM. The agent does not use a complex chaining library like LangChain for this core interaction; it's a more direct and lightweight approach.
    *   **API Request to LLM**: An API request is made to the configured LLM using `openAI.chat.completions.create`. Crucially, this request includes `stream: true` to enable streaming responses and `temperature: 0` / `seed: 42` for consistent outputs.

5.  **LLM Response Generation**: The LLM processes the input messages and begins generating a response, sending it back as a series of chunks or tokens due to the streaming request.

6.  **Stream Production (`src/prompt/index.ts`)**: As the `prompt` function receives these chunks from the LLM, it wraps them in a `ReadableStream`. Each chunk (an `OpenAI.ChatCompletionChunk` object) is formatted as a Server-Sent Event (SSE) string, typically `data: {JSON_chunk}\n\n`, and then encoded to a `Uint8Array` before being enqueued into the stream.

7.  **Streaming to Client (`handlePrompt` in `src/index.ts`)**:
    *   **SSE Headers**: Back in the `handlePrompt` function, appropriate HTTP headers are set on the response to the client (e.g., `Content-Type: text/event-stream`, `Cache-Control: no-cache`, `Connection: keep-alive`) to indicate an SSE stream.
    *   **Forwarding Chunks**: The function reads the SSE-formatted `Uint8Array` chunks from the `ReadableStream` provided by the `prompt` function. Each chunk is immediately written to the HTTP response.
    *   **Flushing**: `res.flush()` is called (if available) after writing each chunk. This ensures that the data is sent to the client without unnecessary buffering, maintaining the real-time nature of the stream.

8.  **Client Processing**: The client application receives these SSE chunks. It can then parse the `data` field (which contains the JSON string of the LLM chunk) and update its UI or process the information as it arrives.

9.  **Stream Completion**: Once the LLM has finished generating its full response, the `ReadableStream` in the `prompt` function is closed. This signals the `handlePrompt` function that the stream is complete. `handlePrompt` then writes a final SSE message, `data: [DONE]\n\n`, to the client and closes the HTTP response. This clearly indicates to the client that no more data will be sent.

This flow ensures that the user receives feedback from the agent as quickly as possible, with messages appearing incrementally as they are generated by the LLM.

## Conclusion
